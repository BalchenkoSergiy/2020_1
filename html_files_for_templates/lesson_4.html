		<p>Aaaand I am back to writing. Now bare with me, this is absolutely going to be<br>
			worth your time, and you will get python running on your EV3 brick, but I feel<br>
			like I have to rant about something first: developers are terrible at sharing<br>
			knowledge and/or writing documentation that is complete. I don’t know why<br>
			this is, but 9 times out of 10 whenever I find myself trying out something<br>
			new, I end up using a large number of sources of information because none<br>
			of the developers took the time to do a proper job. Aaaargh!</p>

		<p>Anyway… back to EV3 and Python. Once I proved myself and the rest of the <br>
			EV3 community out there that writing Swift code for the intelligent brick is <br>
			definitely an exciting option and an admirable effort, it is still a half-baked <br>
			one, awaiting improvements. Naturally, I had to find a worthy substitution, so <br>
			back to scavenging I was — my goals still being more or less the same: <br>
			program the brick in a non-visual way, but in any other language than Java. I <br>
			don’t know… Java is like, just not my thing. I’m too cool for Java and all that <br>
			Oracle nonsense. I ended up looking at Basic and Python.</p>

		<p>Basic flew out the window right away (pun intended) because it runs on … <br>
			Windows! And I ain’t no PC guy. Mac all the way, so Python it is. The website <br>
			— as usual — is another prime example and reason why youngsters tend not to <br>
			go for robotics, or software development in general. Don’t get me wrong, the <br>
			content is mostly there and it’s mostly accurate, but the presentation is so <br>
			uninviting that if I wouldn’t have known that ugly sites are a trademark of <br>
			otherwise brilliant developers, I would have considered it some ancient, <br>
			poorly-maintained 90's site. But it’s not, and it led me to the EV3Dev site <br>
			which is a somewhat more inviting project. There is a lot of information there, <br>
			so much in fact that some might find it overwhelming, which is why I decided <br>
			to focus on one scenario and get you from zero to hero, which basically <br>
			means you’ll start with nothing, but by the end of this you will:</p>

		<p>- have an EV3 intelligent brick running EV3Dev operating system (alongside<br>
			Lego’s OS).</p>
		<p>- have an SSH enabled WiFi connection between your brick and your Mac.</p>
		<p>- be able to copy wirelessly your Python files to the brick (the info on how to<br>
			achieve this is so hidden inside the cracks of the internet, that this post<br>
			may actually be the only other place you’ll find it).</p>
		<p>- be able to write (on your Mac) and run basic programs (on the brick) — this <br>
			is where the EV3Dev site gets it a bit wrong; will go into details a bit further<br>
			on.
